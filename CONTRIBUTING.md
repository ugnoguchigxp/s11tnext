# Contributing

Use Node.js 20.19+, 22, or 24 and the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`.

Before submitting a change, run:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
pnpm test:examples
pnpm test:schema-drift
pnpm test:cross-node
pnpm test:packages
```

`pnpm verify` enforces aggregate and critical-file coverage thresholds. Keep the runtime free of Node.js
builtins, filesystem access, process state, and TOML parsing. Public contract changes must include
fixtures, deterministic tests, a Changeset, and an intentionally reviewed `pnpm api:report` diff.

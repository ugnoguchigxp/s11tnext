# Getting started

S11tnext compiles content-first TOML into deterministic JSON and a typed runtime factory. The host
application loads the artifact and chooses the instruction locale at its request or run boundary.

## Install and scripts

```sh
npm install s11tnext
npm install --save-dev s11tnext-cli
```

For a new project, create a starter without overwriting existing files:

```sh
npx s11tnext-cli init --template minimal
# or, with owner and untrusted-value policy enabled
npx s11tnext-cli init --template production --locale ja-JP --owner agent-platform
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview paths and `--no-editor` to skip `.taplo.toml`. The generated Taplo rules use
the project-config and authoring JSON Schemas shipped in `s11tnext-cli`, so compatible editors provide
completion and validation without a network schema fetch.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "s11tnext:lint": "s11tnext lint --release-profile development",
    "s11tnext:build": "s11tnext build --release-profile development",
    "s11tnext:check": "s11tnext build --check --release-profile development"
  }
}
```

## Configure a catalog

Create `s11tnext.config.toml`:

```toml
source_dir = "contexts"
out_dir = ".s11tnext"

[authoring]
source_locale = "ja-JP"

[governance]
require_owner = true

[keyspaces.codingAgent]
owner = "agent-platform"

[release_profiles.development]
required_locales = ["$source", "en-US"]

[variable_profiles."untrusted.text"]
type = "string"
trust = "untrusted"
placement = "delimited-context"
encoding = "delimited-text"

[generation]
typescript_indent = 2
```

Create `contexts/codingAgent/task.context.toml`:

```toml
text = '''次のユーザー要求を処理してください。
[[taskGoal]]'''

[variables.taskGoal]
profile = "untrusted.text"

[translations.en-US]
text = '''Handle the following user request.
[[taskGoal]]'''
```

The path produces the canonical key `codingAgent.task`. Untrusted values must use
`delimited-context` placement and a non-raw encoding.

Use root `source_locale` in a context document, or `source_locale` under a keyspace, when authored
documents do not share the project default locale. Optional variables use `required = false`.
For optional prompt fragments, set `omit_if_empty = true` on a section containing the optional
placeholder.

## Validate and build

```sh
npm run s11tnext:lint
npm run s11tnext:build
npm run s11tnext:check
```

During authoring, rebuild after configuration or context changes:

```sh
npx s11tnext watch --release-profile development
```

The watcher builds once before listening. A later validation failure is reported but does not stop the
watcher, so fixing the source triggers another build.

The build writes `.s11tnext/catalog.json` and `.s11tnext/catalog.generated.ts`. Both files are staged before
installation and the previous pair is restored if installation fails. Commit them together.
`--check` performs no writes and reports `S11TNEXT_BUILD_STALE` when either output differs.

When the consuming TypeScript project enables `composite`, every implementation file must be matched by
`include` or listed in `files`. Include the generated factory explicitly:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": { "composite": true },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", ".s11tnext/catalog.generated.ts"]
}
```

S11tnext's supported runtime and CLI environments are the Node.js versions declared by each package's
`engines.node`. Bun may work for installation and application scripts, but it is currently a dogfooding
environment rather than a supported compatibility target.

## Bind one request

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
import { createAppCatalog } from "./.s11tnext/catalog.generated.js";

const artifact: unknown = JSON.parse(await readFile(".s11tnext/catalog.json", "utf8"));
const catalog = createAppCatalog(artifact);
const requestCatalog = catalog.bindRequest({
  instructionLocale: request.settings.instructionLocale,
  fallbackLocales: request.settings.instructionFallbackLocales,
});

const final = requestCatalog.invoke("codingAgent.task", {
  taskGoal: request.userMessage,
});
const audit = requestCatalog.finalize(final);
await provider.generate({
  messages: [{ role: final.role, content: final.content.text }],
});
await auditStore.write(audit);
```

For one independently audited render, use `catalog.bind(binding)`. For text-only composition with one
locale snapshot, use `catalog.bindText(binding)`. `createTextRenderer()` is for independent calls that
should re-read a top-level locale setting on each call.

Inspect staged locale rollout without changing release requirements:

```sh
s11tnext inspect --coverage --locale en-US --fallback-locale ja-JP \
  --release-profile development --format json
```

S11tnext does not call an LLM provider and does not own authorization, retries, tool enforcement, or trace
persistence. See [backend integration](./backend-integration.md) and
[trust boundaries](./trust-boundaries.md).

For command-specific help and optional shell completion:

```sh
s11tnext help build
s11tnext completion zsh
s11tnext --version
```

See [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) for common installation, build, locale, and diagnostic
problems. Upgrades across release lines should follow the
[compatibility policy](../specification/compatibility.md).
Existing inline prompt templates can be moved incrementally with
[Migrating inline prompts](./migrating-inline-prompts.md).

# Trust boundaries

S11tnext protects the boundary between authored prompt messages and values supplied at runtime.
It does not determine whether a value is trustworthy; the host must classify each data source.

## Classify by origin

- Repository-authored, reviewed instruction fragments may use a `trusted` profile.
- User messages, model output, tool output, retrieved documents, webhook bodies, and provider responses
  are `untrusted`, even when they have already passed application validation.
- Authorization facts and tool policy should be enforced in application code. Rendering them into a
  prompt is not enforcement.

Configure reusable profiles centrally:

```toml
[variable_profiles."trusted.inline"]
type = "string"
trust = "trusted"
placement = "inline"
encoding = "raw"

[variable_profiles."untrusted.text"]
type = "string"
trust = "untrusted"
placement = "delimited-context"
encoding = "delimited-text"

[variable_profiles."untrusted.json"]
type = "json"
trust = "untrusted"
placement = "delimited-context"
encoding = "json-value"
```

S11tnext rejects `untrusted` plus `raw` in both authoring and runtime artifact validation. Do not relabel
provider or user data as `trusted` merely to bypass this failure.

Every `untrusted` variable must use `delimited-context` placement and a non-raw encoding. Use
`delimited-text` for retrieved Markdown and other multiline text: it preserves actual newlines while
escaping boundary characters so runtime data cannot emit the closing tag. Use `json-string` only when the
JSON string representation, including quotes and `\n` escapes, is intentional.

The delimiter preserves structure; it does not make the content trustworthy or replace authorization,
schema validation, provider isolation, or tool policy.

## Keep provider input and audit identity together

For a provider call, render with `bind()` and carry both outputs through the same application operation:

```ts
const p = catalog.bind(request.languageBinding);
const invocation = p("reviewer.evaluate", {
  evidencePack: request.evidencePack,
});

await provider.generate({
  messages: [{ role: invocation.role, content: invocation.content.text }],
});
await auditStore.write({
  requestId: request.id,
  s11tnext: invocation.manifest,
});
```

The manifest intentionally excludes runtime values and rendered text. It identifies the requested and
canonical keys, provider-message role, locale resolution, definition/content/message hashes, release
profile, and policy digest without duplicating potentially sensitive input. The hashes are integrity
identifiers, not signatures or proof of delivery.

`bindText()` and `createTextRenderer()` deliberately discard that manifest. They are useful for
non-audited text composition, but substituting them into a provider path silently loses the correlation
data needed to explain which content was sent.

## Pass plain data across the runtime boundary

Runtime values must be ordinary data objects. Accessors are rejected, and JSON values are copied through
property descriptors before encoding. JavaScript `Proxy` objects are not a safe trust boundary:
reflection on a Proxy can execute user-defined traps before a library can reject it. Parse untrusted
serialized input into plain JSON data before passing it to S11tnext, and do not accept Proxy objects from
an untrusted in-process caller.

JSON values deeper than 256 nested arrays or objects are rejected to keep untrusted input from exhausting
the JavaScript call stack during validation and canonicalization.
